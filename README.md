### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ This is Norman Zheng, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence @ NPU.

ðŸŒ± I study Computer Vision and Machine Learning, I am particularly interested in Visual Generation(especially stochastic probabilistic methods such as GAN & VAE & Diffusion) and Visual Perception. My long-term research goal is to bridge the fields of Generation and Perception with general mathematical methods, and build intelligent vision system that can comprehend and generate everything like reality.

ðŸ“« I use Github as a repository for my coursework, projects and source codes for upcoming papers. By the way, I enjoy staring and following genius minds(mainly focus on splendid works in AIGC)

ðŸ˜„ Feel free to email me if there is any possible conversation.

âš¡ Keep learning and coding!
