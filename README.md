### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ This is Norman Zheng, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence @ NPU.

ðŸŒ± I study Computer Vision and Machine Learning, I am particularly interested in Image Reconstruction(especially techs that generate pixels from pixels such as GAN & VAE & Diffusion), Visual Perception, and 3D generation.

ðŸ“« I use Github as a repository for my coursework, projects and source codes for upcoming papers in the future. By the way, I enjoy staring and following genius minds(mainly focus on splendid works in AIGC)

ðŸ˜„ Feel free to email me if there is any possible conversation.

âš¡ Keep learning and coding!
