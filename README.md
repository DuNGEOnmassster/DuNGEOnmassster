### Hi there 👋

🔭 This is Norman Zheng, a third-year student majoring in Artificial Intelligence @ NPU.

🌱 I study Computer Vision and Machine Learning, I am particularly interested in Image Reconstruction(especially techs that generate pixels from pixels such as GAN & VAE & Diffusion), Visual Perception, and 3D generation.

📫 I use Github as a repository for my coursework, projects and maybe source codes for papers in the future. By the way, I enjoy staring and following genius minds(mainly focus on splendid works in AIGC)

😄 Feel free to email me if there is any possible conversation.

⚡ Keep learning and coding!
